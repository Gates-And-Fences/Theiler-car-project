# ðŸ”Œ Wiring and Connections

## Overview
This file describes all major electrical connections between the components.

## Power Path

```
[Battery 7.4V]
â”œâ”€â”€> [Buck Converter] â†’ 5V â†’ [ESP32 5V Pin]
â””â”€â”€> [Relay Module] â†’ [Motor]
```

## Ground Path
All grounds **must** connect:

```
Battery GND = Buck Converter GND = ESP32 GND = Relay GND
```

## Signal Path

```
ESP32 GPIO 23 â†’ Relay IN â†’ Motor ON/OFF
```

## Tips
- Use **22 AWG silicone wire** for low-current circuits.
- Use **16â€“18 AWG wire** for motor and battery leads.
- Label wires with tape or heat-shrink for clarity.
